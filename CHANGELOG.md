## [Unreleased]

## Added
- Seeds to multiple algorithims that depend on random number generation.
- Added feature `js` to use WASM in browser
- Drop `nalgebra-bindings` feature
- Complete refactoring with *extensive API changes* that includes:
    * moving to a new traits system, less structs more traits
    * adapting all the modules to the new traits system
    * moving towards Rust 2021, in particular the use of `dyn` and `as_ref`
    * reorganization of the code base, trying to eliminate duplicates

## BREAKING CHANGE
- Added a new parameter to `train_test_split` to define the seed.
