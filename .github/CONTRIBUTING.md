# **Contributing**

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Background

We try to follow these principles:
* follow as much as possible the sklearn API to give a frictionless user experience for practitioners already familiar with it
* use only pure-Rust implementations for safety and future-proofing (with some low-level limited exceptions)
* do not use macros in the library code to allow readability and transparent behavior
* priority is not on "big data" dataset, try to be fast for small/average dataset with limited memory footprint.

## Pull Request Process

1. Open a PR following the template (erase the part of the template you don't need).
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with details of changes to the interface if they are breaking changes, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Pull Request can be merged in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

### generic guidelines
Take a look to the conventions established by existing code:
* Every module should come with some reference to scientific literature that allows relating the code to research. Use the `//!` comments at the top of the module to tell readers about the basics of the procedure you are implementing.
* Every module should provide a Rust doctest, a brief test embedded with the documentation that explains how to use the procedure implemented.
* Every module should provide comprehensive tests at the end, in its `mod tests {}` sub-module. These tests can be flagged or not with configuration flags to allow WebAssembly target.
* Run `cargo doc --no-deps --open` and read the generated documentation in the browser to be sure that your changes reflects in the documentation and new code is documented.

#### digging deeper
* a nice overview of the codebase is given by [static analyzer](https://mozilla.github.io/rust-code-analysis/metrics.html):
```
$ cargo install rust-code-analysis-cli
// print metrics for every module
$ rust-code-analysis-cli -m -O json -o . -p src/ --pr
// print full AST for a module
$ rust-code-analysis-cli -p src/algorithm/neighbour/fastpair.rs --ls 22 --le 213 -d > ast.txt
```
* find more information about what happens in your binary with [`twiggy`](https://rustwasm.github.io/twiggy/install.html). This need a compiled binary so create a brief `main {}` function using `smartcore` and then point `twiggy` to that file.

* Please take a look to the output of a profiler to spot most evident performance problems, see [this guide about using a profiler](http://www.codeofview.com/fix-rs/2017/01/24/how-to-optimize-rust-programs-on-linux/).

## Issue Report Process

1. Go to the project's issues.
2. Select the template that better fits your issue.
3. Read carefully the instructions and write within the template guidelines.
4. Submit it and wait for support.

## Reviewing process

1. After a PR is opened maintainers are notified
2. Probably changes will be required to comply with the workflow, these commands are run automatically and all tests shall pass:
    * **Coverage** (optional): `tarpaulin` is used with command `cargo tarpaulin --out Lcov --all-features -- --test-threads 1`
    * **Formatting**: run `rustfmt src/*.rs` to apply automatic formatting
    * **Linting**: `clippy` is used with command `cargo clippy --all-features -- -Drust-2018-idioms -Dwarnings`
    * **Testing**: multiple test pipelines are run for different targets
3. When everything is OK, code is merged.


## Contribution Best Practices

* Read this [how-to about Github workflow here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) if you are not familiar with.

* Read all the texts related to [contributing for an OS community](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/hydrus/tree/master/.github).

* Read this [how-to about writing a PR](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and this [other how-to about writing a issue](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-write-our-github-issues/)
  
* **read history**: search past open or closed issues for your problem before opening a new issue.

* **PRs on develop**: any change should be PRed first in `development`

* **testing**:  everything should work and be tested as defined in the workflow. If any is failing for non-related reasons, annotate the test failure in the PR comment.
