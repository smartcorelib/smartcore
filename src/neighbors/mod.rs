//! # Nearest Neighbors
//!
//! The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
//! KNN is a non-parametric method that assumes that similar things exist in close proximity.
//!
//! During training the algorithms memorizes all training samples. To make a prediction it finds a predefined set of training samples closest in distance to the new
//! point and uses labels of found samples to calculate value of new point. The number of samples (k) is defined by user and does not change after training.
//!
//! The distance can be any metric measure that is defined as \\( d(x, y) \geq 0\\)
//! and follows three conditions:
//! 1. \\( d(x, y) = 0 \\) if and only \\( x = y \\), positive definiteness
//! 1. \\( d(x, y) = d(y, x) \\), symmetry
//! 1. \\( d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y) \\), 	subadditivity or triangle inequality
//!
//! for all \\(x, y, z \in Z \\)
//!
//! Neighbors-based methods are very simple and are known as non-generalizing machine learning methods since they simply remember all of its training data and is prone to overfitting.
//! Despite its disadvantages, nearest neighbors algorithms has been very successful in a large number of applications because of its flexibility and speed.
//!
//! __Advantages__
//! * The algorithm is simple and fast.
//! * The algorithm is non-parametric: thereâ€™s no need to build a model, the algorithm simply stores all training samples in memory.
//! * The algorithm is versatile. It can be used for classification, regression.
//!
//! __Disadvantages__
//! * The algorithm gets significantly slower as the number of examples and/or predictors/independent variables increase.
